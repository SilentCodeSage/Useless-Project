## Project Description

Excuse Generator is a fun web app that creates imaginative excuses for any situation. Users can adjust the absurdity and seriousness levels for each excuse, making it both adaptable and entertaining. APIs are used to add a layer of realism, such as integrating live weather data.

### The Problem
